# Chat Server

A feature-rich, multi-threaded, terminal-based chat application built in C++ using Winsock for networking. Implements a client-server architecture supporting multiple users, public/private rooms, direct messaging, and admin management.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **User Authentication**  
    Secure login/signup with user data persisted in a local CSV file.

- **Multi-Room Chat**  
    Create, join, list, and leave chat rooms. Return to the main lobby anytime.

- **Real-Time Communication**  
    - Chat in the main lobby with all users  
    - Private room-specific chat  
    - Direct one-to-one messaging

- **Admin Capabilities**  
    - Role-based permissions (User/Admin)  
    - View all users across rooms (`/whoall`)  
    - Remove users from rooms (`/kick`)  
    - Permanently delete rooms (`/deleteroom`)

- **Dynamic UI**  
    Responsive terminal interface using ANSI escape codes for colored text, dynamic prompts, and clean UI updates.

## ðŸ›  Technical Stack & Concepts

- **Language:** C++17  
    Modern features: `<thread>`, `<mutex>`, `<vector>`, smart stream manipulation

- **Networking:** TCP/IP Sockets  
    Winsock2 library for low-level network communication (Windows only)

- **Architecture:** Client-Server  
    One-thread-per-client model for concurrency

- **Synchronization:**  
    Uses `std::mutex` and `std::lock_guard` for thread-safe access to shared data

- **Communication Protocol:**  
    Custom, line-based ASCII protocol using `\n` as message delimiter

- **Data Persistence:**  
    User credentials, admin status, and nicknames saved to `users.csv` in local directory

- **User Interface:**  
    Terminal UI managed with ANSI escape codes for color, cursor movement, and line clearing

## âš¡ How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Windows environment
- C++17 compiler (e.g., MinGW g++ 11+ version needed)

### Compilation

```bash
# Compile the server
g++ server.cpp -o server.exe -std=c++17 -lws2_32 -static

# Compile the client
g++ client.cpp -o client.exe -std=c++17 -lws2_32 -static
```

### Execution

Start the server: in one terminal
```bash
./server.exe
```

Start clients (in separate terminals):
```bash
./client.exe
```

## ðŸ§ª Feature Testing Scenario

1. **User Authentication**
     - Client 1: Signup 
     - Client 2: Login 

2. **Chat & Commands**
     - Chat in Lobby as PlayerOne and TesterTwo
     - `/who` to list users in Lobby
     - `/list` to show available rooms

3. **Room Management**
     - PlayerOne: `/create gaming`
     - TesterTwo: `/list` (should show `gaming`)
     - Both: `/join gaming`
     - Chat in `gaming` room; Lobby users can't see messages
     - `/leave` to return to Lobby

4. **Private & Admin Messaging**
     - PlayerOne: `/msg <username> This is a private test`
     - Admin: `/whoall` (lists all users/rooms)
     - PlayerOne: `/whoall` (permission denied)

5. **Admin Actions**
     - TesterTwo joins `gaming`
     - Admin: `/kick ts` (TesterTwo returns to Lobby)
     - Admin: `/deleteroom gaming` (room deleted, notifications sent)

## ðŸš§ Drawbacks & Scope for Improvement

While this project achieves its core goals and demonstrates key concepts, it was designed as a learning exercise. A production-ready chat server would benefit from enhancements in several areas:

### 1. Scalability

- **Current Limitation:**  
    The server uses a one-thread-per-client model, which is simple but does not scale efficiently. High thread counts can degrade performance due to context-switching overhead.

- **Potential Improvement:**  
    Adopt an asynchronous, event-driven I/O model (e.g., IOCP on Windows, epoll on Linux, or Boost.Asio for cross-platform support) to handle thousands of concurrent connections with fewer threads.

### 2. Security and Data Persistence

- **Current Limitation:**  
    User passwords are stored in plain text within `users.csv`, and all communications are sent unencrypted over the network.

- **Potential Improvement:**  
    - Store passwords as securely hashed and salted values (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).  
    - Encrypt all network traffic using TLS/SSL (OpenSSL or similar), protecting user privacy and credentials.


### 3. History / Data storage > 
    - Chat messages are ephemeral and are not saved anywhere. When the server restarts, all conversations are lost. Users joining a room have no context of the previous discussion.

-  **Improvement**: Implement a chat logging system. A simple solution would be to append messages to a text file for each room (e.g., logs/room_name.txt). A more advanced implementation would store messages in a database, allowing for features like retrieving the last N messages when a user joins a room.
